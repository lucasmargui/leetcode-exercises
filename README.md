Online platform for coding interview preparation and the service provides coding and algorithmic problems intended for users to practice coding.


## Two Pointers

The two-point technique involves using two indices or pointers that traverse a data structure, usually moving according to certain conditions. The two hands can move in several ways:

One at the beginning and one at the end: The hands start at opposite ends and move toward the center.
Both from the beginning: One pointer can be slower or faster than the other, useful in problems where the relationship between elements in different positions needs to be checked.


Initialize two pointers: one at the beginning (left) and one at the end (right) of the array.

  - Calculate the sum of the elements indicated by left and right.
  - If the sum equals the target, the numbers have been found.
  - If the sum is less than the target, move the left pointer to the right (increment).
  - If the sum is greater than the target, move the right pointer to the left (decrement).
  - Repeat until the hands cross or the sum is found.
